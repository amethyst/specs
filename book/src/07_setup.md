# The `setup` stage

So far for all our component storages and resources, we've been adding
them to the `World` manually. In Specs, this is not required if you use
`setup`. This is a manually invoked stage that goes through `SystemData`
and calls `register`, `add_resource`, etc. for all (with some exceptions)
components and resources found. The `setup` function can be found in
the following locations:

* `ReadStorage`, `WriteStorage`, `Read`, `Write`
* `SystemData`
* `System`
* `RunNow`
* `Dispatcher`
* `ParSeq`

During setup, all components encountered will be registered, and all 
resources that have a `Default` implementation or a custom `SetupHandler` 
will be added. Note that resources encountered in `ReadExpect` and `WriteExpect`
will not be added to the `World` automatically.

The recommended way to use `setup` is to run it on `Dispatcher` or `ParSeq` 
after the system graph is built, but before the first `dispatch`. This will go 
through all `System`s in the graph, and call `setup` on each.

## Custom `setup` functionality

The good qualities of `setup` don't end here however. We can also use `setup`
to create our non-`Default` resources, and also to initialize our `System`s!
We do this by custom implementing the `setup` function in our `System`.

Let's say we have a `System` that process events, using `shrev::EventChannel`:

```rust,ignore
struct Sys {
    reader: ReaderId<Event>,
}

impl<'a> System<'a> for Sys {
    type SystemData = Read<'a, EventChannel<Event>>;
    
    fn run(&mut self, events: Self::SystemData) {
        for event in events.read(&mut self.reader) {
            [..]
        }
    }
}
```

This looks pretty OK, but there is a problem here if we want to use `setup`.
The issue is that `Sys` needs a `ReaderId` on creation, but to get a `ReaderId`, 
we need `EventChannel<Event>` to be initialized. This means the user of `Sys` need
to create the `EventChannel` themselves and add it manually to the `World`.
We can do better!

```rust,ignore
use specs::prelude::Resources;

#[derive(Default)]
struct Sys {
    reader: Option<ReaderId<Event>>,
}

impl<'a> System<'a> for Sys {
    type SystemData = Read<'a, EventChannel<Event>>;
    
    fn run(&mut self, events: Self::SystemData) {
        for event in events.read(&mut self.reader.as_mut().unwrap()) {
            [..]
        }
    }
    
    fn setup(&mut self, res: &mut Resources) {
        use specs::prelude::SystemData;
        Self::SystemData::setup(res);
        self.reader = Some(res.fetch_mut::<EventChannel<Event>>().register_reader());
    }
}
```

This is much better; we can now use `setup` to fully initialize `Sys` without
requiring our users to create and add resources manually to `World`!

**If we override the `setup` function on a `System`, it is vitally important that we 
remember to add `Self::SystemData::setup(res);`, or setup will not be performed for
the `System`s `SystemData`.**
