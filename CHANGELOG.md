# [Unreleased]

* Fix `Allocator::kill` in the case of atomically created entities. ([#440])

[#440]: https://github.com/slide-rs/specs/pull/440

# 0.12.1

* Add `#[must_use]` to entity builders to avoid people forgetting to call `.build()`. ([#443])

[#443]: https://github.com/slide-rs/specs/pull/443

# 0.12.0

* `Join::open()` and `Storage::unprotected_storage_mut()` have been marked unsafe.
Thanks to [@andrewhickman](https://github.com/andrewhickman) for discovering this
unsoundness!
* Add common `Builder` trait to `EntityBuilder` and `LazyBuilder` ([#426])
* Add common `MarkedBuilder` trait to `EntityBuilder` and `LazyBuilder` ([#426])
* Add `LazyUpdate::exec_mut` which allows adding a resource from a system ([#433])
* Add `build_entity()` to `EntitiesRes` so you can use builder syntax in a system.
* Add `marked()` to LazyBuilder to keep parity with EntityBuilder ([#420])
* Fix `U64MarkerAllocator`'s internal index not being updated on `saveload::DeserializeComponents` ([#420])

## 0.11.0

* Improve docs, book and examples ([#278], [#281], [#283], [#285], [#296], [#313], [#316], [#322], [#350], [#356], [#363])
* Add `StorageEntry` for easier handling of inserting/removing component ([#274])
* Add `EntityBuilder::marked` convenience method ([#287])
* Add `saveload` module for easy entity serialization ([#275], [#337])
* Add `nightly` feature flag for unstable features. ([#290])
* Add `TrackedStorage`, a more ergonomic variant to `FlaggedStorage` ([#291])
* Exclusive/mutable aliasing for getting an `EntityBuilder` to prevent unsafety. ([#294])
* Add `Bundle` for registering multiple resources and components at once. ([#296])
* Add `get()` method to `Join` for retrieving a single entities component in bulk. ([#299])
* Implementations of `Join` for owned `BitSet`s, including `AtomicBitset`. ([#303])
* Remove `FlaggedStorage` (new storage uses the same name) and `TrackedStorage` in favor of the new `Tracked` api. ([#305])
* Add `prelude` module for commonly used structures and traits. ([#305])
* Add `LazyBuilder` for easier entity construction in systems. ([#320])
* Replace `Entry` with `PairedStorage` to prevent runtime checks for `RestrictedStorage`. ([#324])
* Deprecate `check()` which hides a possibly expensive clone. ([#326])
* Add `ChangeSet` for easy application to components. ([#344])
* Use criterion.rs for benchmarks ([#348])
* Update to rayon 1.0 ([#352])
* Add `World::system_data` method ([#369])
* BREAKING: Change the way resources are handled (see below) ([shred#77])
* Export all items currently in prelude in the root of the crate ([#394])
* If an EntityBuilder drops before being built the entity will now be deleted on maintain ([#394])
* Removed some redundancy in documentation ([#394])

There is one bigger breaking change in this release. Almost all`Fetch` / `FetchMut` types need to be replaced
with `Read` / `Write`. Both require the resource to implement `Default`, because now the resources can be
added to the world automatically. If you want to make the resource optional and you don't have a sensible
default, `Option<Read>` / `Option<Write>` can be used. If you absolutely need the resource and it doesn't
work without, use `ReadExpect` which will panic in case the resource does not exist (that's the same
behavior as before).
