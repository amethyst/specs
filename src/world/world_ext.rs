/// This trait provides some extension methods to make working with shred's
/// [World] easier.
///
/// Many methods take `&self` which works because everything
/// is stored with **interior mutability**. In case you violate
/// the borrowing rules of Rust (multiple reads xor one write),
/// you will get a panic.
///
/// ## Difference between resources and components
///
/// While components exist per [Entity], resources are like globals in the
/// `World`. Components are stored in component storages ([MaskedStorage]),
/// which are resources themselves.
///
/// Everything that is `Any + Send + Sync` can be a resource.
///
/// ## Built-in resources
///
/// There are two built-in resources:
///
/// * `LazyUpdate` and
/// * `EntitiesRes`
///
/// Both of them should only be fetched immutably, which is why
/// the latter one has a type def for convenience: `Entities` which
/// is just `Fetch<EntitiesRes>`. Both resources are special and need
/// to execute code at the end of the frame, which is done in
/// `World::maintain`.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```
/// use specs::prelude::*;
/// # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
/// # struct Pos { x: f32, y: f32, } impl Component for Pos { type Storage = VecStorage<Self>; }
/// # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
/// # struct Vel { x: f32, y: f32, } impl Component for Vel { type Storage = VecStorage<Self>; }
/// # struct DeltaTime(f32);
///
/// let mut world = World::new();
/// world.register::<Pos>();
/// world.register::<Vel>();
///
/// world.insert(DeltaTime(0.02));
///
/// world
///     .create_entity()
///     .with(Pos { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 })
///     .with(Vel { x: -1.0, y: 0.0 })
///     .build();
///
/// let b = world
///     .create_entity()
///     .with(Pos { x: 3.0, y: 5.0 })
///     .with(Vel { x: 1.0, y: 0.0 })
///     .build();
///
/// let c = world
///     .create_entity()
///     .with(Pos { x: 0.0, y: 1.0 })
///     .with(Vel { x: 0.0, y: 1.0 })
///     .build();
///
/// {
///     // `World::read_storage` returns a component storage.
///     let pos_storage = world.read_storage::<Pos>();
///     let vel_storage = world.read_storage::<Vel>();
///
///     // `Storage::get` allows to get a component from it:
///     assert_eq!(pos_storage.get(b), Some(&Pos { x: 3.0, y: 5.0 }));
///     assert_eq!(vel_storage.get(c), Some(&Vel { x: 0.0, y: 1.0 }));
/// }
///
/// let empty = world.create_entity().build();
///
/// {
///     // This time, we write to the `Pos` storage:
///     let mut pos_storage = world.write_storage::<Pos>();
///     let vel_storage = world.read_storage::<Vel>();
///
///     assert!(pos_storage.get(empty).is_none());
///
///     // You can also insert components after creating the entity:
///     pos_storage.insert(empty, Pos { x: 3.1, y: 4.15 });
///
///     assert!(pos_storage.get(empty).is_some());
