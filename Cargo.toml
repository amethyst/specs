description = """
Parallel Entity-Component System.

Specs is a parallel ECS in Rust. It combines the performance of the beast with the flexibility of a cat.

Objectives:

- Automatically parallelize workload, while following Rust ownership rules applied to the components.
- Do not restrict the storage implementation for a particular component.
- Place no constraints onto the component types themselves, allow defining them in user modules.
- Have low overhead, high safety, and optimal ergonomics.
