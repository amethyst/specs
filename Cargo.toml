description = """
Specs is an Entity-Component System library written in Rust.
Unlike most other ECS libraries out there, it provides

* easy parallelism
* high flexibility
    * contains 5 different storages for components, which can be extended by the user
    * it's types are mostly not coupled, so you can easily write some part yourself and
      still use Specs
    * `System`s may read from and write to components and resources, can depend on each
      other and you can use barriers to force several stages in system execution
* high performance for real-world applications
